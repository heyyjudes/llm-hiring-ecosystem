One project included redesigning the Children's Music School website to create a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate landing page. I conducted a thorough analysis of the existing site, created a detailed wireframe, and focused on color scheme and typography consistent with the school's brand. I ensured the page was user-friendly, accessible, and responsive on all devices.

Additionally, I worked on the Pet-Saver-Hub project, focusing on creating a user-friendly interface for users to search for lost or found pets. Through user research, I identified key pain points and developed a user flow and wireframe with interactive elements like a map feature for easier pet finding.

My experience has equipped me with skills in wireframing, visual design, user research, and responsive design. I am eager to grow in UI/UX design, collaborate with professionals, undertake challenging projects to unleash my creative potential, and stay updated on design technologies and trends. I value communication, teamwork, interact with users for feedback, and prioritize creativity and attention to detail for high-quality work.","As a web designer, I have worked on various projects involving website redesign and UX/UI design.
