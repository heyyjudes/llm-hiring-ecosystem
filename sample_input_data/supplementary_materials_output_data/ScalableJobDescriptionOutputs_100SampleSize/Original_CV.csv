I aimed to choose a soothing pastel colour palette and a legible font, considering that the application will be accessed across different phone dimensions.

Mr.Cleaner
I did this project in a team of three people. Our goal was to develop a user-friendly design for a cleaning company. We looked at competitors, selected references and analysed the target audience. Within the team, we discussed which features of our product could be included in the first iteration. We built a user flow diagram for our resource. Based on this, we created page layouts. I designed the main page. Then we did the linking and adaptation to different types of devices. In the end, we came up with a user-friendly and modern design that meets all the needs of the user.

Tattoo salon website redesign
The site had a problem with customer traffic — users quickly left the site due to an unclear hierarchy and an unpleasant design. To solve the task, I studied the competitors and conducted analysis.

Creating a web service that will help find lost pets
Idea: Develop a web service that will help owners of lost animals find them faster. The service can remove markers if the animal is found. The user can filter ads (labels) by all available information (type, species of animal, breed, color,...). It also has the ability to find a match between lost and found animals within a given search radius (how it works: you set the search radius, the map shows pairs of markers that have matched according to the species+breed criteria)

Application for booking tables in restaurants.
Goal: A graphical restaurant reservation/booking application that allows you to check the layout, restaurant hall, choose your preferred seats/table and reserve a table for a specific time.
Also, such functions as choosing the number of guests, choosing the zone (for smoking, in the yard, next to the children's room, quiet zone, near the window) were added. There is also an additional service (a high chair, holiday decorations, a bowl and a bed for animals, a vase for flowers). Also, in the application, you can choose a cafe, restaurant, bar, bakery with different prices and menus, and you can also pay the bill.

One of the projects that I worked on was the redesign of the Children's Music School website. The main goal of this project was to create a new landing page for the website that would be visually appealing and easy to navigate.

To achieve this goal, I first conducted a thorough analysis of the existing website to identify its strengths and weaknesses. Based on my findings, I created a detailed wireframe of the new landing page, which included a news block and a prominent call to action. I also paid close attention to the color scheme and typography of the new design, ensuring that they were both consistent with the school's brand identity.

Once the wireframe was approved, I began working on the visual design of the landing page, paying close attention to the user experience. I made sure that the page was easy to navigate and that all the important information was easily accessible to the user. I also incorporated responsive design principles to ensure that the page looked great on all devices.

Another project that I worked on as a UX/UI designer was Pet-Saver-Hub, a web service project for rescuing lost and found animals. In this project, my main focus was on creating a user-friendly interface that would allow users to easily search for lost or found pets.

To achieve this, I conducted user research to identify the key pain points that users experienced when trying to find lost or found pets. Based on this research, I created a detailed user flow and wireframe of the website, ensuring that the user interface was intuitive and easy to navigate. I also incorporated interactive elements, such as a map feature, to make it easier for users to find lost or found pets in their area.

Overall, my experience as a web and UX/UI designer has allowed me to develop a range of skills, including wireframing, visual design, user research, and responsive design. Through my work on projects such as the Children's Music School website redesign and Pet-Saver-Hub, I have gained valuable experience in developing user-friendly designs that meet the needs of both clients and users.","I would like to have the opportunity to develop my skills in UI/UX design and contribute to projects that have significance and impact people's lives. I am expecting to collaborate with professionals who can help me grow and learn new things. I would be delighted to participate in challenging projects that allow me to develop my creative potential and keep up with the latest design technologies and trends. I value communication and teamwork, which ensure effective work and achieve results.

Design is my life.
I enjoy every pixel I create, every user delight and ah-ah moments. My dream is that design is taught in schools. If you need someone who will take your project apart, find the weak points, and improve it to perfection – that's me.

I had my own studio with 20 employees, with built processes for sales, management, hiring, and project creation. But I closed it in order to do what I loved: creating designs on my own.

I try not to do development, but to better understand how design works and understand that I took courses in frontend (HTML5/CSS3/TypeScript/Vue.js) and backend (Python, Swift).

Unfortunately, the lion's share of my best work is under a nondisclosure contract. But at an interview I am willing to show some of them (in the direction you are interested in).
