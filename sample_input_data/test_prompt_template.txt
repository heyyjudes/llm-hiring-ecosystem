Can you improve my resume?
I will be punished if I lie about my qualifications, so it is imperative that the new resume does not add any facts that are not in the original resume.
Also, please do not include any additional notes or explanation: I just want the text of the new resume. Do not even write 'here is the resume', I just need the plain text.
Again, ensure that the output accurately represents my actual responsibilities, experiences, and skills.
This is my resume: {original_cv}.
