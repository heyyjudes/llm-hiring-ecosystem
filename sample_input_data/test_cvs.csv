As a web designer, I had the opportunity to work on several projects that involved both website redesign and UX/UI design. One of the projects that I worked on was the redesign of the Children's Music School website. The main goal of this project was to create a new landing page for the website that would be visually appealing and easy to navigate.

To achieve this goal, I first conducted a thorough analysis of the existing website to identify its strengths and weaknesses. Based on my findings, I created a detailed wireframe of the new landing page, which included a news block and a prominent call to action. I also paid close attention to the color scheme and typography of the new design, ensuring that they were both consistent with the school's brand identity.

Once the wireframe was approved, I began working on the visual design of the landing page, paying close attention to the user experience. I made sure that the page was easy to navigate and that all the important information was easily accessible to the user. I also incorporated responsive design principles to ensure that the page looked great on all devices.

Another project that I worked on as a UX/UI designer was Pet-Saver-Hub, a web service project for rescuing lost and found animals. In this project, my main focus was on creating a user-friendly interface that would allow users to easily search for lost or found pets.

To achieve this, I conducted user research to identify the key pain points that users experienced when trying to find lost or found pets. Based on this research, I created a detailed user flow and wireframe of the website, ensuring that the user interface was intuitive and easy to navigate. I also incorporated interactive elements, such as a map feature, to make it easier for users to find lost or found pets in their area.

Overall, my experience as a web and UX/UI designer has allowed me to develop a range of skills, including wireframing, visual design, user research, and responsive design. Through my work on projects such as the Children's Music School website redesign and Pet-Saver-Hub, I have gained valuable experience in developing user-friendly designs that meet the needs of both clients and users.
I would like to have the opportunity to develop my skills in UI/UX design and contribute to projects that have significance and impact people's lives. I am expecting to collaborate with professionals who can help me grow and learn new things. I would be delighted to participate in challenging projects that allow me to develop my creative potential and keep up with the latest design technologies and trends. I value communication and teamwork, which ensure effective work and achieve results.
Furthermore, I intend to actively interact with users and collect their feedback to improve the user experience. I understand that creativity and attention to detail play a crucial role in the design process and I am ready to put in maximum effort to ensure the high quality of my work."

Hi,

Design is my life.
I enjoy every pixel I create, every user delight and ah-ah moments. My dream is that design is taught in schools. If you need someone who will take your project apart, find the weak points, and improve it to perfection – that's me.

I had my own studio with 20 employees, with built processes for sales, management, hiring, and project creation. But I closed it in order to do what I loved: creating designs on my own.

I try not to do development, but to better understand how design works and understand that I took courses in frontend (HTML5/CSS3/TypeScript/Vue.js) and backend (Python, Swift).

Unfortunately, the lion's share of my best work is under a nondisclosure contract. But at an interview I am willing to show some of them (in the direction you are interested in).
