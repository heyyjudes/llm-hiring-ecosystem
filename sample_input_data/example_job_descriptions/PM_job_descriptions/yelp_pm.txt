Yelp’s mission is to connect people with great local businesses. On the Yelp Restaurants team, we’re dedicated to transforming the dining out experience for both diners and restaurants. Whether diners are planning two weeks or 20 minutes in advance, our goal is to allow them to easily browse and get a table at the restaurant they love. From casual to fine dining, our goal is to fill restaurants’ tables so that they can maximize revenue while streamlining operations and delivering the best guest experience.

We’re looking for an experienced Lead Product Manager who can develop a deep understanding of restaurateurs and consumers and how we can serve them better. You’ll work with our established Engineering and Design teams, as well as dedicated Sales, Customer Success, and Marketing teams.

Are you passionate about working on products that are used and loved by millions of people every day? At Yelp, you’ll have an opportunity to make a real impact on a product you actually use. The team you’ll work with is innovative, nimble, and fun. The culture at Yelp is a unique environment combining the best parts of being at a startup with the stability and resources of a successful public company. You’ll have full ownership of your focus area and will be able to make fast decisions in a highly collaborative environment.

This opportunity is fully remote and does not require you to be located in any particular state within the US. We welcome applicants from throughout the US. We’d love to have you apply, even if you don’t feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we’re looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.
