 I am a motivated professional with a diverse background in HR management and a growing passion for development and project management. Throughout my experience as an HR Manager in an IT company, I discovered a keen interest in both the technical aspects of development and the coordination of projects.

My journey into the world of development began with front-end courses. I honed my skills in various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. Through this experience, I gained proficiency in popular frameworks and tools such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Git. Additionally, I learned how to work with APIs.

Building upon my front-end development skills, I embarked on a volunteer project with Chingu. Over a span of six weeks, I collaborated with a team of four developers to create an e-commerce website using React.js and Tailwind. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills in a real-world setting, reinforcing my passion for development.

However, I realized that I wanted to combine my expertise in HR management with my newfound knowledge of development. This led me to pursue a deep dive into project management. Currently, I am actively studying two project management courses to acquire the necessary skills to bring teams together and excel as a manager.
