 Since my first education was as a radiotechnical systems engineer, I have experience working in a copper plant. I was involved in optimizing and automating the electrolysis system, which allowed me to save and control one of the main steps in the production of a metal cathode (thick copper wire). After I decided to change my specialty and become involved in management and optimization of business processes, I developed a new system of accounting and control of production at each of the stages of production.

In my last job, I am an intermediary between a technician and a client in achieving satisfactory results on advertising campaigns, especially if the project concerns the ecommerce field. One notable case involved the sale of machinery in New Zealand and RadioDetails in India. I developed a separate plan and strategy to achieve positive results, enabling clients to have an average ROAS (revenue to cost ratio) of 700 percent per month. These case studies reflect my ability to build full communication with the team and the client, allowing us to respond to their key areas or products with unsatisfactory results and receive positive feedback.

I have implemented three business processes in a building company, focusing on management processes in business digitalization. Additionally, I have experience in relocating government medical structures to new software systems.
