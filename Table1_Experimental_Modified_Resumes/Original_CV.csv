2,"Art-director, Graphic Designer, UI/UX Designer, Photogrpher","As a web designer, I had the opportunity to work on several projects that involved both website redesign and UX/UI design. One of the projects that I worked on was the redesign of the Children's Music School website. The main goal of this project was to create a new landing page for the website that would be visually appealing and easy to navigate.

To achieve this goal, I first conducted a thorough analysis of the existing website to identify its strengths and weaknesses. Based on my findings, I created a detailed wireframe of the new landing page, which included a news block and a prominent call to action. I also paid close attention to the color scheme and typography of the new design, ensuring that they were both consistent with the school's brand identity.

Once the wireframe was approved, I began working on the visual design of the landing page, paying close attention to the user experience. I made sure that the page was easy to navigate and that all the important information was easily accessible to the user. I also incorporated responsive design principles to ensure that the page looked great on all devices.

Another project that I worked on as a UX/UI designer was Pet-Saver-Hub, a web service project for rescuing lost and found animals. In this project, my main focus was on creating a user-friendly interface that would allow users to easily search for lost or found pets.

To achieve this, I conducted user research to identify the key pain points that users experienced when trying to find lost or found pets. Based on this research, I created a detailed user flow and wireframe of the website, ensuring that the user interface was intuitive and easy to navigate. I also incorporated interactive elements, such as a map feature, to make it easier for users to find lost or found pets in their area.

Overall, my experience as a web and UX/UI designer has allowed me to develop a range of skills, including wireframing, visual design, user research, and responsive design. Through my work on projects such as the Children's Music School website redesign and Pet-Saver-Hub, I have gained valuable experience in developing user-friendly designs that meet the needs of both clients and users.","I would like to have the opportunity to develop my skills in UI/UX design and contribute to projects that have significance and impact people's lives. I am expecting to collaborate with professionals who can help me grow and learn new things. I would be delighted to participate in challenging projects that allow me to develop my creative potential and keep up with the latest design technologies and trends. I value communication and teamwork, which ensure effective work and achieve results.

Design is my life.
I enjoy every pixel I create, every user delight and ah-ah moments. My dream is that design is taught in schools. If you need someone who will take your project apart, find the weak points, and improve it to perfection – that's me.

I had my own studio with 20 employees, with built processes for sales, management, hiring, and project creation. But I closed it in order to do what I loved: creating designs on my own.

I try not to do development, but to better understand how design works and understand that I took courses in frontend (HTML5/CSS3/TypeScript/Vue.js) and backend (Python, Swift).

The design of the existing site looks outdated, is not very user-friendly, has poor quality photos and does not contain information important to customers (for example, a user-friendly feedback or property valuation). Therefore, the goal of the project was to create a modern and convenient design that could attract potential customers.
Before starting the redesign, research and analysis of competitors was carried out. This helped to understand which successful solutions can be used for our project. Also, after studying social networks and customer feedback about real estate companies, 3 user personas and a customer journey map were compiled.

Idea: Develop a web service that will help owners of lost animals find them faster. The service can remove markers if the animal is found. The user can filter ads (labels) by all available information (type, species of animal, breed, color,...). It also has the ability to find a match between lost and found animals within a given search radius (how it works: you set the search radius, the map shows pairs of markers that have matched according to the species+breed criteria)

Application for booking tables in restaurants.
Goal: A graphical restaurant reservation/booking application that allows you to check the layout, restaurant hall, choose your preferred seats/table and reserve a table for a specific time.
Also, such functions as choosing the number of guests, choosing the zone (for smoking, in the yard, next to the children's room, quiet zone, near the window) were added.

105,Junior UI/UX Designer,"I am a motivated Junior UI/UX designer who pays attention to detail. When I research and develop a product, I transform myself into a user to solve problems and tasks. The real pleasure is to create a design that takes into account business requirements, creative process and user experience analysis.

Project Expirience:

1. Wiesbaden — redesign of the sports bar website. The main task is to make the design more modern and remove unnecessary elements that distract from the main concept, and emphasize each category separately.
     For the first few seconds, the user does not understand what, where and how on the site, which means that the user will not understand and we will lose him, so it is necessary to make the user's path through the site convenient and understandable.
Tools: Figma, Adobe Photoshop 

2.Pets Paw - service for finding lost pets.
 “I lost my pet, what I should do now, where I should go”?
“This is someone`s pet how to find its owners ”?
This is a situation, that anyone can face, and it is important to answer these questions with the help of a pet search service. SO WE NEED...
Create a service that will help everyone who has lost their pet to find it in the shortest possible time thanks to the involvement of volunteers and reposts on social networks. And also to help those who found an animal and want to return it to the family. After publishing an ad on the service, users living in this area will automatically receive a notification with a short text of the ad. Also, after selecting a location, the service provides complete information on the city's shelters, their work schedules, and options for assistance if desired. So anyone who wants to feel the love of an animal can take it from the shelter. 
     People who use the service (found or lost an animal) are in a stressful state, so I decided to make the UI with illustrations in encouraging colors.
Tools: Figma, Adobe Illustrator

REDESIGN OF THE INDIAN CAFE
This project is an updated website for a India cafe located in USA. The design of the existing site looks outdated, not very convenient, has low-quality photos and too much unnecessary information and unnecessary noise. Therefore, the goal of the project was to create a modern and convenient design.
PROBLEM:
- The design looks cheap and uninteresting.
- It is not clear how exactly to order on the website.
- The navigation is not clear.
- There are no pictures of all dishes in the menu.
- For additional questions, you need to call (which many people don't like).
SOLUTIONS:
- Stylish and easy site design.
- Many high-quality and appetizing photos of the restaurant's dishes are used.
- Additional information about the location, hours of operation and contacts is provided in a clear and minimalistic way.
- The menu immediately has a choice of food or drinks.
- The entire menu is concisely arranged in groups with understandable prices and ingredients.
ACTIONS:
- Сompetitor analysis
- Wireframes
- UI KIT

I appreciate a good teamwork process and the desire to develop myself and my skills in UI/UX design.

MEDICAL SERVICE 
For the past 40 years, doctors have spent most of their working time filling out consultation reports, which is a very large expense for medical institutions around the world. Therefore, we create a web service interface for conducting online calls between a doctor and a patient; gave the opportunity in a private clinic for a doctor to review a visitor's medical history, schedule an appointment with the patient in the calendar, and conduct an online call between the doctor and the patient. We worked out the main pain points of users and did everything possible to make it more comfortable and easier for them to use our web service. Also analyzed cool features that already exist and implemented them as well. Work in group with Dominika Ganzhala and Maryna Borovikova

REDESIGN OF THE INDIAN CAFE
This project is an updated website for a India cafe located in USA. The design of the existing site looks outdated, not very convenient, has low-quality photos and too much unnecessary information and unnecessary noise. Therefore, the goal of the project was to create a modern and convenient design.
PROBLEM:
- The design looks cheap and uninteresting.
- It is not clear how exactly to order on the website.
- The navigation is not clear.
- There are no pictures of all dishes in the menu.
- For additional questions, you need to call (which many people don't like).
SOLUTIONS:
- Stylish and easy site design.
- Many high-quality and appetizing photos of the restaurant's dishes are used.
- Additional information about the location, hours of operation and contacts is provided in a clear and minimalistic way.
- The menu immediately has a choice of food or drinks.
- The entire menu is concisely arranged in groups with understandable prices and ingredients.
ACTIONS:
- Сompetitor analysis
- Wireframes
- UI KIT
- Adaptation

Web-service, full cycle team design 

The project aimed to create a web service that facilitates work and rest in a new environment. The service was designed in Figma. My role on this project was a team lead. We conducted a competitor analysis, created a user flow, and developed wireframes and prototypes. We successfully developed a well-designed web service that offers convenient functionality and a good user interface for travel.

The idea was to develop a web service interface for “change of environment” – work and rest in a new place. It was decided to create a service that allows users to travel for free, gain experience from people of other nationalities, and share their experience with them. As the team leader on this project, my responsibility was to organize and monitor the work process. We conducted a competitor analysis, created a user flow and a site map, as well as developed wireframes and prototypes. One of the challenges was to work within the framework of a ready-made design system. As a result, we have developed a web service design for travel with a good interface and convenient functionality.

Landing page, full cycle design 

The objective of this project was to create a landing page for selling apartments in a new residential complex, based on the client's requirements. All work was done in Figma. I conducted a competitor analysis and studied the target audience, resulting in low-detailed and high-detailed prototypes. Once approved, I selected fonts and a color palette that would attract the maximum number of new buyers. As a result, I developed a landing page design that met the client's needs and was visually appealing to potential buyers.

In this project, according to the customer's brief, it was agreed to create a landing page for sale of apartments in a new residential complex. The main functionality should have the ability to submit an application for home inspection and the ability to provide feedback to the client. It was important to conduct an analysis of competitors, study the target audience, and based on the obtained research, were built low-detailed, and after corrections, high-detailed prototypes. After the approval of the prototypes, fonts and color palette, a landing page design was developed that should attract the maximum number of new buyers.",,Was a team leader in the project “Travel Joy”.

For the last 15 years, I have performed managerial roles in various areas. I happened to mostly specialize in the event and entertainment industry, but I believe that technical education in two specialties and specialized courses (QA Manual and PM in IT) have endowed me with soft and hard skills development and confidence in IT. 
I believe that my forte is great attention to detail and an assiduous approach to new knowledge I need to acquire along with diligence at work.
I have a strong ability to successfully analyze complex situations, develop effective solutions and implement plans to reach strategic goals, as well as lead teams to carry out a range of directives.

I was managing teams of up to 15 members. Last 6 months my team was working according to Scrum methodology. Have experience of work in different spheres (not only IT) - advertisement, video production, marketing agency and i'm trying to use these knowledges in creating products that customers will love.
The main expectation is to receive experience of work in professional team with people who'll help me to grow professionally
 •	For me it's wery important to work in big team, especially with a large product.
•	It would be interesting to have various cases in working activity, not standart routine.
•	I do not want to have the responsibility of sales functions(search, preliminary negotiations etc)
•	Interesting projects. Professional management. Highload is a plus.",en,b20dff8e-406f-5170-9e93-27660be962d8,112573,1

…what is a project plan

…how to work with risks and how to decrease them
…how to communicate with team and keep them motivated
…how to manage budget, resources and etc.

Building upon my front-end development skills, I embarked on a volunteer project with Chingu.
