Personal Statement  
Design is my life. I take pride in every pixel I create, striving to deliver user delight and ""aha"" moments. My dream is to see design taught in schools. If you need someone who can dissect your project, identify weaknesses, and refine it to perfection, I am your ideal candidate.  
I previously managed a 20-person studio, building processes for sales, management, hiring, and project execution. I closed the studio to focus on my passion: creating designs independently.  
While I avoid development, I have taken courses in frontend (HTML5/CSS3/TypeScript/Vue.js) and backend (Python, Swift) to better understand how design integrates with technology.  
Due to nondisclosure agreements, much of my best work cannot be shared publicly. However, I am happy to discuss and showcase relevant projects during interviews."
